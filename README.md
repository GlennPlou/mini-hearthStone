The application is now hosted by Heroku! It is accessible here : https://mini-hearthstone.herokuapp.com/

This is our M1 ALMA project for the module "Analyse, Conception et Mise en Oeuvre de Logiciels".

`Pre-requisite`: This application requires an internet connection, Java 8.0, Maven 3.5 and NPM 6.4.

DISCLAIMER: For reasons beyond our control, the application does not work using the university of Nantes network. It seems that the access to the database hosting service (mLab) is blocked.

`Server installation`: Open a console on MHServer and run "mvn clean install". You can then start it by running "mvn spring-boot:run".

The design folder contains UML class diagrams of the architecture of the server.

The analyseStatique folder contains the result of the PMD analysis.
